# Neat JS Implementation
This project is my personal implementation of the Neat AI algorithm in Javascript. It includes:
- Javascript implementation of the Neat algorithm
- a rudimentary Graphics utility class to visualize the algorithm
- Javascript implementation of the Asteroids game

This implementation follows [Neat AI](https://www.youtube.com/@neatai6702)'s [walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbvrrdymF0&list=PLnICFpQDyZRFqjdtcTjshOb1IJqns6h6w) of Kenneth Stanley's Neat algorithm. I utilized [Pezzza](https://www.youtube.com/@PezzzasWork)'s [implementation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvV5Qtp_fYg&t=106s) of the layer calculation for each node since I quite liked it.

This project is available for anyone to look at, use, and modify however they choose. It will undergo numerous changes so be sure to check back every once in a while if it seems like I'm still here. :)

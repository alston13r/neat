# Neat JS Implementation
This project is my personal implementation of the Neat AI algorithm in JavaScript. It has a source directory written in TypeScript and utilizes the glMatrix library.

This implementation follows [Neat AI](https://www.youtube.com/@neatai6702)'s [walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbvrrdymF0&list=PLnICFpQDyZRFqjdtcTjshOb1IJqns6h6w) of Kenneth Stanley's Neat algorithm. I previously utilized [Pezzza](https://www.youtube.com/@PezzzasWork)'s [implementation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvV5Qtp_fYg&t=106s) of the layer calculation for each node since I quite liked it, but in favor of optimization that code has been redone.

This project is available for anyone to look at, use, and modify however they choose. It will undergo numerous changes so be sure to check back every once in a while if it seems like I'm still here. :)

There are demo pages available through the navigation site which feature some usage of the Neat algorithm as well as some other pieces that will be incorporated later.
